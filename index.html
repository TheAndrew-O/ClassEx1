        <h1>Part 2 - 2D Single Agent Navigation</h1>
        <p>In order to navigate the agent along the path while not colliding with obstacles, the TTC algorithm was used.<br>
        The agent is provided a list of targets to move towards and a list of obstacles to avoid.<br>
        When the agent reaches a target/goal, the next node in the list of goals is set as the goal for the agent to move towards.<br>
        I had trouble making the agent acceleration not stop and start at each node.<br>
        I attempted to smooth the transitions between nodes by modifying the goal force attracting the agent.</p>

        <h1>3D Simulation of A* Pathfinding in Unity</h1>
        <p>The following features were implemented</p>
        <h2>3D Rendering & Camera</h2>
        <p>The lighting is cast at an angle to simulate natural lighting and shadows.<br>
           There are 4 cameras, they are mapped to the numbers 1-4. 2 cameras show different angles of the map. 2 cameras follow a tank at different angles.
        </p>

        <h2>Improved Agent & Scene Rendering</h2>
        <p>There are three agents, 2 of them are 3D low-poly tanks and the other is a capsule.<br>
            The obstacles are 3D low-poly rocks and buildings. I did not make these assets, they are from the Unity asset store.<br>
            The assets came with mesh colliders, but the obstacle avoidance was done mostly by me.<br>
            The obstacle avoidance was implemented by creating an unwalkable layer-mask and applying it to the grid coordinates of where the obstacles are located.<br>
            I then used Unity's built in Physics library to call the CheckSphere function which will check if a node is walkable, given an unwalkable layer-mask.
        </p>

        <h2>Incorporate Particle Systems</h2>
        <p>I tried to implement particles in Unity from scratch. It was difficult and I was only getting particles with missing textures.<br>
            I instead used the built in particle system to spawn particles in the smokestack.

        <h2> Orientation Smoothing</h2>
        <p>To orientate the tanks towards their goals, the angle of rotation was calculated using the arctangent.<br>
            To smooth the orientation so that it didn't immediately snap to the new direction, I used the function SmoothDampAngle<br>
            with Euler's function to calculate the angles of rotation needed.

        <h2>Multiple Agents Planning</h2>
        <p>To process multiple agents moving simultaneously, a movement handler was created to process each path created.<br>
            I ran into major issues with the game stalling for a second or two as it tried to calculate the paths.<br>
            To fix this issue a handler was implemented to to process each path at seperate frames, not all at once on the same frame.<br>
            I then have another class to handle the tank's movement.
